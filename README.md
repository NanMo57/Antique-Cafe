This project is a dynamic scrolling website where content moves while the background remains fixed. As the user scrolls, sections transition seamlessly, creating an engaging and immersive experience. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery) to achieve smooth animations and interactive effects.
